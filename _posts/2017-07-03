title: Does fox news feature individauls wearing uniform more?
---

The motivation of this side project comes from wanting to understand whether certain media outlets are more likely to post pictures of individuals in uniform to emphasize on a narrative that resonates or sympathizes with the authority.

This is the first neural network I trained the model using 2048 images of individuals in uniform, and 1840 of random images. The model achieves 88% accuracy, which isn't all that great but has given me a first taste of image classification.
