The longer I have worked in tech and side-by-side with talented software engineers, the more I became interested in the fundamentals of CS. I recently finished a data structure course on coursera. To be honest, it was by no means easy, and tracing through the logic of the code often requires you to be completely alert and focused. But it was also incredibly satisfactory to see your code works, and runs fast! I did not know what a difference does efficient code makes until actually diving into it myself.
