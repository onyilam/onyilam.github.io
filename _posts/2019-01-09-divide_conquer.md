title: Divide and Conquer
---

The longer I have worked in tech, the more I became interested in the fundamentals of CS. So I  recently started and finished a data structure course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer">coursera</a>. The course was more challenging than I originally anticipated. Tracing through the logic of the code often requires you to be completely alert and focused, and it sometimes feels like a mind gymnastic class. Still, it was incredibly satisfying to see your code works, and runs fast! As a data scientist, I often write one-off analysis scripts that do not place much emphasis on performance. So naturally, I did not know what a difference does efficient code and suitable data structure makes until forcing myself to think like a software engineer.
